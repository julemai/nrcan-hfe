				"comment" : "Southern Alberta, June 19-28, 2013. A massive storm system crept through Alberta causing significant flooding throughout the province. As of 2013, this event was responsible for the largest evacuation due to a natural disaster in Alberta's history. Beginning in northern Alberta, Fort McMurray declared a local state of emergency when water from the Hanging Stone River breached its banks on June 8. The storm then moved south on June 19, where it remained for three days over southern Alberta. Heavy rain spanning across a region from Canmore to Calgary produced an average of 75 to 150 mm during this three-day period. Twenty-nine local states of emergency were declared throughout the province. Four deaths were attributed to the floods, which caused significant disruptions across the province to power, telecommunications, clean water supply, and transportation corridors, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway that closed due to a mudslide caused by the torrential rain. In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion. This disaster is estimated to have reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Southern Alberta by $550 million (2013 dollars).",

Heavy rainfall flooding is common in urban areas where water temporarily accumulates due to more precipitation than can be removed by infiltration into the ground (e.g., due to impervious surfaces where infiltration is limited) or by drainage through infrastructure or the river system. Heavy precipitation and storm surges can be accompanied by high winds, as in the case of post-tropical cyclones. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation accompanied by a rise in temperature will have an impact on the supply of meltwater from the snow cover on the peaks.",

MacDonald said some rivers in Halifax were at their capacity Sunday, but there were no reports of major flooding. Some people were moved because the road to their homes was flooded, preventing access by emergency vehicles.Homeowners living on rivers, lakes and flood plains did what they could Wednesday to prepare for up to 75 more millimetres of rain expected to fall on the South Shore by tonight, on top of the 160 millimetres that had already come down.Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm has estimated the damage to provincial highways and bridges to be at least $1 million.
