Heavy rainfall flooding is common in urban areas where water temporarily accumulates due to more precipitation than can be removed by infiltration into the ground (e.g., due to impervious surfaces where infiltration is limited) or by drainage through infrastructure or the river system. Heavy precipitation and storm surges can be accompanied by high winds, as in the case of post-tropical cyclones. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation accompanied by a rise in temperature will have an impact on the supply of meltwater from the snow cover on the peaks.",
